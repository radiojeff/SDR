 V042 Mar 07, 2023  Jack Purdum (W8TEE) This is expected to be the final version of the software. The version supplied 
  uses IDE 2.0.4 and uses the CrashReport object in the code. I have commented out these calls in setup().
    Fixed: Crashreport calls commented out.
    Fixed: calibrate values persisted to EEPROM
    Fixed: moved the dxCities[] table to a local variable so there's plenty of stack space
    Add: symbolic constant SD_CARD_PRESENT to do conditional compiles based on presence/absence of SD card
