  Purpose: void FreqShift1()
          AFP 12-31-20
        Frequency translation by Fs/4 without multiplication from Lyons (2011): chapter 13.1.2 page 646
        together with the savings of not having to shift/rotate the FFT_buffer, this saves
        about 1% of processor use

        This is for +Fs/4 [moves receive frequency to the left in the spectrum display]
           float_buffer_L contains I = real values
           float_buffer_R contains Q = imaginary values
           xnew(0) =  xreal(0) + jximag(0)
               leave first value (DC component) as it is!
           xnew(1) =  - ximag(1) + jxreal(1)
  Parameter list:
    void

  Return value:
    void

/*****
  Purpose: Shift Receive frequency by an arbitray amount

  Parameter list:
    void

  Return value;
    void
    Notes:  Routine includes checks to ensure the frequency selection stays within the bounds of the
    displayed spectrum
    Also included a variable frequency step, depending on how fast the encoder id turned.  Step varies from 50Hz/step to 10KHz/step

    freq_conv2()

    FREQUENCY CONVERSION USING A SOFTWARE QUADRATURE OSCILLATOR (NCO)

    THIS VERSION calculates the COS AND SIN WAVE on the fly AND IS SLOW

    MAJOR ADVANTAGE: frequency conversion can be done for any frequency !

    large parts of the code taken from the mcHF code by Clint, KA7OEI, thank you!
      see here for more info on quadrature oscillators:
    Wheatley, M. (2011): CuteSDR Technical Manual Ver. 1.01. - http://sourceforge.net/projects/cutesdr/
    Lyons, R.G. (2011): Understanding Digital Processing. â€“ Pearson, 3rd edition.
    Requires 4 complex multiplies and two adds per data point within the time domain buffer.  Applied after the data
    stream is sent to the Zoom FFT , but befor decimation.
